# SNA-shiny
Introduction

This Shiny app (on R) takes in example data from R about characters from a book to develop an SNA graph. The user has the ability to interact with the graph as well as change it through different inputs (The choosegroup input only works with "full" and 1 as inputs)

Getting Started
1. Download RStudio.
2. Before running it locally, you will need to install the packages (once they're install, you can just call "library()"). 3. Uncomment out the code that says "install.packagess()" the first time.
4. Put all of the files in the same folder.

Next Steps

The main next step is to get this app (or any Shiny app) deployed onto Azure. We have tried multiple things, but have not found out a solution yet. The main tutorial we used to try deploying the app before is linked below. https://www.puresourcecode.com/programming-languages/r/deploying-dockerized-r-shiny-apps-on-microsoft-azure/
